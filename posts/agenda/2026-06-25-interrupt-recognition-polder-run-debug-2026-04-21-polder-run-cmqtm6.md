Polder run debug — 2026-04-21

# Polder run debug — 2026-04-21

Case study. The first overnight ralph run (Polder game, llama3.3 planner + qwen2.5-coder:32b via aider) spent twenty-two iterations making no progress on the brief and was killed in the morning. The retrospective found seven distinct bugs, each small, each invisible on its own, together producing a loop that looked busy and shipped nothing of what it was supposed to. The point of writing it down is so the next overnight run doesn't repeat any of them, and the pattern-recognition transfers to whatever rig comes after ralph.

## What the run looked like when I found it

Iteration counter at 22. Five Python files at the workspace root: `entry.py`, `game.py`, `main.py`, `pygame_entry.py`, `sound_effects.py`. An empty `src/` directory. `BRIEF.md` at 455 bytes — still the seed stub with `(Describe the game in 1-3 sentences.)` placeholders. `PLAN.md` at its seed default ("The planner keeps this file current. Empty on a fresh workspace."). `NOTES.md` the same. `JOURNAL.md` populated with entries, each carrying stray ANSI escape sequences like `[6D[K`. `DECISIONS.md` with Pygame "locked in" four separate times on iterations 1, 14, 16, and 21.
