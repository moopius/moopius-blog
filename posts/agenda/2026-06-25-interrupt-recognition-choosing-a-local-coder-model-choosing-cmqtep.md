Choosing a local coder model

# Choosing a local coder model

This article is a decision guide for picking a locally-hosted coding model — primarily for use inside an aider-driven loop like [ralph](../ralph/overview.md), but the considerations generalise. It assumes you're on Apple Silicon with 64–128 GB of unified memory (the common hobbyist-to-serious-user range). Numbers need updating as the field moves; the reasoning underneath should age better.

## The choice that matters most: dense or MoE

Before a specific model, the architectural fork. Modern open-weight code models come in two shapes, and the difference dominates every other consideration.

A *dense* model activates every parameter on every token. `qwen2.5-coder:32b` is the canonical example: 32 billion parameters, all engaged for every forward pass. Memory footprint equals total parameters × bytes-per-parameter. Compute-per-token is proportional to total parameters. Simple to reason about, mature tooling support, historically the default.

A *Mixture of Experts* (MoE) model has many specialised sub-networks ("experts") and a routing layer that picks a small subset for each token. `qwen3-coder:30b` is 30 billion total parameters but only about 3.3 bi…
